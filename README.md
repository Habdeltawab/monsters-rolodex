# React, Redux, GraphQL Understanding

## React Concepts

- DOM is the document object module
- It handels the DOM updates
- Building websites like lego blocks (reusable componenets)
- Unidirectional data flow, anytime something needs to change, the state needs to change (makes it easier to debug)

## React Keywords

- Declarative
- JSX
- State
- Props
- Components
- VirtualDOM

## General Info

- src folder is where the application lives

## React lifecycle methods

- Methods that get called at certain stages of the component
- ComponentDidMunt(): when this component mounts, it calls whatever code written inside

## State vs Props

- State is something that changes depending on user's interaction
- Props

## Destructuring

- Destructuring allows us to pull properties of an object and set them to constants
